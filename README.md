This repo is for basic python scripts that I have created to make everyday work a little bit easier.

IP_Lookup.py - Runs nslookup on list of IPs in file and dumps hostnames into a file
Hostname_Loopup.py - Runs nslookup on list of Hostnames in file and dumps ips into a file
SSLScan_with_File_Creation.py - Runs a sslscan then creates a registry file for windows machines to disable weak protocols
